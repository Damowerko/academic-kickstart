I am a Senior at University of Pennsylvania pursuing a dual-degree between Systems Engineering and Physics. For the last
three years I have been researching the applications of graph neural networks to energy systems, about which I published
two [papers](#featured). I believe that in many such systems we do not utilize all available information - for example
most electricity consumers do not receive price signals. By taking advantage of new technologies and data we can
dramatically increase system efficiency.

I am also a passionate member of [Penn Electric Racing](https://pennelectricracing.com), where I am a software lead.
We are a team of over 60 students dedicated to designing, manufacturing, and competing with a formula electric car at
formula student (FSAE).
